## Linuxing Around

Whatever the heck that means.

We all know linux is great... [it does infinite loops in 5 seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Linux/Selected_quote/4).

### Vim
Nobody *knows* vim.  Everyone who uses it is *learning* vim.

And on my quest for vimprovement...
* https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-anti-patterns/
* [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/blob/master/README.md) - a very fast, local personal wiki albeit with a custom markup

### Bash
Bash is good for some stuff.  And then there's [Bash on Balls](https://github.com/jneen/balls), the web framework in bash that nobody asked for.

Some links to help me on my way:
* [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
* [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/blob/master/neofetch) demonstrates ways of collecting a wide array of system information
* <http://samrowe.com/wordpress/advancing-in-the-bash-shell/>
* Google's [shell style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)

### Lede/OpenWRT
Yeah, I built my own router.  Sort of.  I don't actually have it running yet.  On my path to VPNlightenment, I've [picked up some stuff](/hobbies/openwrt/).

### Books
I've been meaning to take a closer look at [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/).
