## Woodworking

So, I'm barely even a novice.

I've done:
* a pair of [rast racks](http://www.ikeahackers.net/2012/05/rast-transformed-in-a-19-inch-rack-mount.html) (stain, finish, minor modification to increase the rack slots that fit, added legs).
* stained and finished an ikea [gerton](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50106773/) desktop
* made a [pikachu pinewood derby car](https://boyslifeorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/pokemon-feature.jpg) (that's not the one we made, that's just the picture my son picked out that we based it on).

Someday, I'd like to make a few custom computer cases from wood, kinda like [slipperyskip's](http://slipperyskip.com/page33.html).

I'd also like to mod my boring, plasticky alarm clock to have a nice wood case.
